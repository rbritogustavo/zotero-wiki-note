# Zotero Wiki Note
Ever wanted to recreate the style of Wikipedia in your academic notes? Well, now you can! 
## How it works
This template helps you import your Zotero highlights and comments to a new note formatted in the style of Wikipedia (infobox included) without the need of installing a specific theme or complex CSS schemes. 
## Requirements 
The template uses two Obsidian plugins, but only one is required:
- [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration)
- [Auto Note Mover](https://github.com/farux/obsidian-auto-note-mover)

Using the Auto Note Mover plugin if more of a convenience so all your notes can be sent to a specific folder based on a trigger. If your system doesn't use folders you can skip it without a problem.
## How to configure
Import the template file to your vault and put the CSS file in the snippets folder (.obsidian/snippets/), then activate the CSS snippets in Appearance -> CSS snippets. If necessary, reload Obsidian.
### Zotero Integration
This is the most important part of this workflow; without proper configuration, Obsidian will not communicate with Zotero and your highlights/comments will no be imported.
